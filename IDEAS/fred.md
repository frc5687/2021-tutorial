# Tutorial Ideas - Fred Horch

- Quiz for students to make sure they've read and understood the tutorial
- Get students involved reviewing and keeping tutorial up to date
- Break up into multiple files as we drill down into details about deploying code, etc.
- Have a "JV" track for students new to programming: give each student a ROMI to train
- Stick with TimedRobot or use Command Robot design pattern?
- Have veteran mentors review tutorial for technical accuracy
