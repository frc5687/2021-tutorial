# The Road Ahead

- [ ] Meet the robots - pictures and descriptions of our current stable of robots
- [ ] Checking out a repo from GitHub - how to get issue branch or main branch, commit ID
- [ ] Building a project - launch gradle from vscode
- [ ] Running a desktop simulation of the robot before loading code onto a real robot
- [ ] Deploying code to the real robot - both over WiFi (outside of competitions) and via USB or Ethernet cable (in the pits during competitions)
