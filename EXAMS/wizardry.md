Arcane incantations are required to summon and influence the forces that animate our robots. The Outliers Wizardry Exams ensure that our team has student wizards who possess the required knowlege and skill to safely and effectively control our robots.

Each wizardry exam for the 2021-2022 season is conducted hands on with the chassis bot or the competition bot. A wizard mentor must sign off on the exam before a wizard earns a level.
