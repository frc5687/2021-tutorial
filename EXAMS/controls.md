Arcane incantations are required to summon and influence the forces that animate our robots. The Outliers Controls Exams ensure that our team has students who possess the required knowlege and skill to safely and effectively control our robots.

Each controls exam for the 2021-2022 season is conducted hands on with the chassis bot or the competition bot. A team mentor must sign off on the exam before a student earns a level.  Students must be able to complete every exam task independently to pass.

From time to time we add or remove exam tasks.  We track these with a revision letter (A through Z).  For example, for revision B of the level one exam we have added knowing how to find the version of the code running on the robot.
