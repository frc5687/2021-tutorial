Use this folder for sharing knowledge, especially research about what other teams are doing.

For our purposes, one of the best sources of information is other teams' repos on GitHub.  The problem is that there is a huge amount of information and it gets stale quickly.  So one of the things we should be doing as a team is research -- find out which teams are doing cool stuff, wrap your mind around it, and write it up in this folder.

For the 2022 season, we are especially interested in improving our localization and mapping abilities.  We have two main ways to determine where we are on the field:

 1. Odometry
 2. Vision

Each team member is encouraged to create a self-named file in this folder and keep it updated with what you learn that might be helpful to other team members.

Thanks for gathering and sharing robotics knowledge!
