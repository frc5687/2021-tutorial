# Open Alliance

Teams that have decided on an open build season can join the Open Alliance. The #openalliance members all believe that FRC can have a greater impact on all teams if our ideas are shared throughout the season.  With the end of The Bag, there’s a chance that FRC teams may become more secretive than they are now, and we’re hoping to stop that trend before it has a chance to start. We think that teams can share information and still be competitive, and that a rising tide lifts all boats.
