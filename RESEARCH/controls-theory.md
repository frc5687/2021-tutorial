# Controls Theory

WPILib provides [advanced controls features](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/index.html), such as various feedback/feedforward control algorithms and trajectory following.

## Tyler Veness

Tyler Veness wrote *[Controls Engineering in the FIRST Robotics Competition](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf)* as a final project for an undergraduate technical writing class he took at University of California, Santa Cruz in Spring 2017 (CMPE 185). It is intended as a digest of graduate-level control theory aimed at veteran FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) students who know algebra and a bit of physics. As he learned the subject of control theory, he found that it wasn't particularly difficult, but very few resources exist outside of academia for learning it. This book is intended to rectify that situation and lower the barrier to entry to the field.

- All scripts in the code directory are runnable by the user. They require Python 3.5+ and [frccontrol](https://github.com/calcmogul/frccontrol).
- Example Python scripts can be obtained from frccontrol's Git repository at [https://github.com/calcmogul/frccontrol/tree/main/examples](https://github.com/calcmogul/frccontrol/tree/main/examples).

- Provides wrappers around [Python Control](https://github.com/python-control/python-control) for making development of state-space models for the FIRST Robotics Competition easier.

- The Python Control Systems Library is a Python module that implements basic operations for analysis and design of feedback control systems.
