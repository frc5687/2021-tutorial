# Dennis' Robotics Research

## Teams Of Interest:

 - Team 900 [Zebracorns](https://team900.org/labs/):  Team has pretty complex software that is probably out of the scope of what we want/can do.
 - Team 254: One of the best teams in the world. Don’t always release software.
 - Team 2910: Well known swerve team
 - Team 1114: Another one of the best in the world teams.
 

## Localization & Vision:

### Cameras:
 - Zed camera by Stereolab’s
 - Intel Cameras (discontinued?) Depth, Lidar, Slam, Etc.
 - Algorithms for localization:

### [Kalman Filter Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter):
 - Kalman Filter (For Linear Systems)
 - Extended Kalman Filter (Non-linear Systems by linearizations with jacobians.)
 - Unscented Kalman Filter (Non-linear, Sampling technique better than EFK, more computationally expensive)

### [Particle Filter / Monte Carlo Localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_localization#Basic_description):
 - Commonly used for indoor localization
 - Computationally expensive as well.
