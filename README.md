Tutorial for 2021-2022 school year to help students start programming (controls)

## Getting Started

### Note

CAUTION: The following information is copied from the 2019 tutorial and is subject to change this year.  Once this tutorial has been updated with this year's plan, this caution notice will be removed.

Because the FRC Driver Station runs only on Windows, most of us have chosen to do our programming in Windows as well.  You are free to use Mac OSX, but these instructions will cover only Windows installations.
