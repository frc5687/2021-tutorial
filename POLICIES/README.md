# Outliers Controls Team Policies for 2022 Season

- Don't mess with main -- work on a branch.
- Create an issue in GitHub.
- Create an issue branch named subsystem/issue#-description.
- Main branch is protected.
- A mentor (Dennis or John Tower) reviews code before it gets merged to main.

## Future Policies

- Pull requests must pass unit tests. (Once we have our testing and mocking framework established.)
