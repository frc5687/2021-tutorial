# How to Use Git

## How can I make Git "forget" about a file that was tracked, but is now in .gitignore?

There is a file that was being tracked by Git, but now the file is on the .gitignore list.

However, that file keeps showing up in git status after it's edited. How do you force Git to completely forget about it?
